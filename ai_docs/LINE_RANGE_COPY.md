# Command to copy references to blocks of text in files.

The goal of this command is to be able to quickly collect an appendix of references to code snippets in a codebase.
It works by:

- Select a ${src/test/install_deps.sh} block of text in a file
- Press Cmd+4 and it will insert into the clipboard a reference to the file and the lines that are selected.
